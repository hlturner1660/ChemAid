<h2>Potassium hydrogen phthalate Safety Information</h2>
<p> Potassium hydrogen phthalate  (KHP) may cause eye irritation.
It cause skin irritation and may be harmful if absorbed through the skin.
It may cause irritation of the digestive tract. May be harmful if swallowed and cause respiratory tract irritation. May be harmful if inhaled.</p>
<blockquote>
Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes, occasionally lifting
the upper and lower eyelids. If irritation develops, get medical aid. Immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical aid if irritation develops or persists.
Do not induce vomiting. Get medical aid if irritation or symptoms occur.
Remove from exposure and move to fresh air immediately. If not breathing, give artificial
respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Get medical aid if cough or other
symptoms appear.

<h2>Potassium hydrogen phthalate Reagent Information</h2>
<p> Potassium hydrogen phthalate is an acidic salt compound. It is a white colorless solid. It is often used as a 'primary standard' for standardization of sodium hydroxide or other strong alkaline solution. Its molecular formula is   C8H5KO4. 
KHP dissociates completely in water, giving the potassium cation (K+) and hydrogen phthalate anion (HP− or Hphthalate−). As a weak acid hydrogen phthalate reacts reversibly with water to give hydronium (H3O+) and phthalate ions. 
It is also called KHP. It is a solid, air stable and can be accurately weighed for standardization purpose. KHP is laso used as a buffer. The pH of an aqueous solution of KHP is 4.0.
