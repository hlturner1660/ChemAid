<h2>Know Your Chemistry Laboratory Glassware</h2>

<h1>Buret</h1>

<p>Buret is a volumetric glassware. It is made of a long tube with graduations on it. Please move your fingers in the upward direction. 

This buret has 50 major divisions, each representing one milliliter (or mL) volume of a reagent. There are 10 subdivisions within two 

successive major divisions. Each subdivision measures 0.1 mL. Using a funnel, reagent is poured in a buret. Buret has a stopcock at the lower end. 

Flow of a reagent can be controlled by a stopcock. Stopcock is turned in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction to control the flow of a reagent. 

Buret is used in a laboratory to deliver a measurable quantity of a reagent to a container or a flask.</p>



<p>Reagent added from a buret chemically reacts with a chemical sample of unknown concentration. The quantity of reagent added from a buret 

helps determine the concentration an unknown sample. The process of adding a reagent from buret to complete the chemical reaction with an unknown 

sample and determining the concentration of an unknown sample is called ‘volumetric titration’.</p>
