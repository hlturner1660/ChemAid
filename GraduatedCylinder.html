<p>Graduated cylinder is a volumetric apparatus made of glass or plastic. This graduated cylinder measured 50 milliliters of volume of a liquid. It stands on a base made of plastic or glass. Please move your fingers in the upward direction. The major and minor lines represent 10 and 1 millileters, respectively. Desired volume of a liquid can be measured and or delivered from a graduated cylinder. Graduated cylinders are available in various sizes including 10, 25, 50, 100, and 250 milliliters. Large size graduated cylinders can measure volumes in liters.

<p>However, for more accurate measurement of volumes, other volumetric-ware like buret, pipet, and volumetric flask are used. </p>
